Compared banks teller lines efficiency against grocery store queues using Singly Linked Lists and simulated time-steps
Used a lexicon trie to simulate T-9 word texting.
Designed a final exam schedule using greedy algorithms, binary search trees, and graphs represented through adjacency lists.

Solved word subset and the Two Towers puzzles using vectors and iterators, comparing anticipated and actual big-O run times.
