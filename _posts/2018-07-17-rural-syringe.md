Developed the first peer-to-peer needle exchange program for rural syringe access in Massachusetts to combat HIV/Hepatitis C outbreak clusters and fatal overdoses due to opioid use. The peer exchange program is estimated to impact over 30,000 individuals in rural Western Massachusetts. Work also included supporting the Assistant Director of Harm Reduction Programs in identifying and addressing organizational pain points, many of which are addressed in the program outline. Solutions included harnessing underutilized resources, the part-time relocation of talented employees to high-need sites, streamlined training processes, and increased communication across Syringe Access Programs. During the summer of 2018, the SAP programs served over 98,000 individuals. As of Fall 2018, a new SAP location has opened in Springfield. This increases the population with SAP access to 252,700+ people.
