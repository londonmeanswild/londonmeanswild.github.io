Traveled to Kuwait during Spring Break 2018 to interview queer and lesbian-identified Kuwaiti women and their expatriate partners. Topics discussed include community-building, social lives, and family dynamics in a country where being LBGTQ-identified is illegal. 

Final ethnography was submitted for the 2018 Kenneth W. Payne Student Prize.
