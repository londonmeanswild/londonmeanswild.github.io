Python application utilizing the Twitter API. Demonstrates potential spheres of influence due to Twitter's retweet feature.  

Users are prompted to enter two Twitter handles into the terminal line. This program can be used to map relational paths and degrees of separation between users. Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/londonmeanswild/Twitter_projects).

Below is an excerpt from [twitter_relationships.py](https://github.com/londonmeanswild/Twitter_projects/blob/master/twitter_relationships.py). 

```
if looking_for in followers:
    print("{} is in {}'s list of followers".format(looking_for, searched_account))
if looking_for not in followers:
    print("{} is not in {}'s list of followers".format(looking_for, searched_account))

user_two = tweepy.Cursor(api.followers, screen_name=looking_for, include_entities=True).items()
second_follower = [profile.screen_name for profile in user_two]
users_REPAIR = [api.get_user(name) for name in second_follower]
fuids2 = [follow_two.id for follow_two in users_REPAIR]

second_user = input("Which account would you like to find in {}'s followers? ".format(looking_for))

```
