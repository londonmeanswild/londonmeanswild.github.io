Assisted in clean-room development of Swift data structures following Apple design principles. 

The [Swift](https://github.com/londonmeanswild/swift) structures provide programmers with experimental data structure classes including LinkedLists, DoublyLinked Lists, and Circular Lists. [Swift is an open-source programming language developed by Apple.](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) My research poster can be found [here](https://github.com/londonmeanswild/londonmeanswild.github.io/raw/master/_posts/swift.png).

Below is an excerpt from [Vector Tools](https://github.com/londonmeanswild/swift/blob/master/vectorTools.swift)

```

 /**
     func insert will add a new value to the array, at a specified location.
     It finds a location to insert a value then moves the array values so the new value fits.
     
     - parameters:
     - var finger: defaults to last item in the array. Identifies and tracks the insert location.
     */
    func insert(_ newElement: T, at i: Int) {
        ensure(hasCapacity: size + 1)
        var finger: Int = size - 1
        while i <= finger {
            data[finger + 1] = data[finger]
            finger = finger - 1
            
        }
        size = size + 1
        data[i] = newElement
    }
